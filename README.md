## A walk through the #60DAYSOFUDACITY Challenge

## Day 1: Lesson 1:The Analytical Problem

## Covered
**Strategy for solving problems.

## The Problem Solving Framework
**CRISP-DM :** | Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining

### CRISP-DM FRAMEWORK

## A brief summary of the stages in the framework
**Business Issue Understanding :** Develop a mental model while answering questions such as :
  * What decisions needs to be made
  * What information is needed to info that decision
  * What analysis will provide the information to inform that decision
  
**Data Understanding :** Start with data collection/identify data problems/subsets. Try and answer :
  * What data is needed
  * What data is available
  * What are some of the important characteristics of the data
  
**Data Preparation :** Here you will go through the Gathering| Cleasing| Formatting| Blending| Sampling.
  * Gathering: Collecting data from multiple sources.
  * Cleasing: Resolving issues prior to analysis/doing away with missing or incorrect data.
  * Formatting: Changing how the data appears/renaming fields.
  * Blending: Combining the data/Joining.
  * Sampling: Working with more manageable number of records.
   
**Analysis and Modeling :** Determine the methodology to use to use to solve the problem + Determine the important factors + variables to help solve the problem.
  * Run the model and move to the validation phase.
  
**Validation :** Here we are getting to a certain level of confidence in our model.
  * Observe the key results on the model and which variable help predict better results.
  * Ensure the results make sense within the context of the business problem.
  * Repeat the process.

**Presentation :** Effectively communicate results to decision makers.
  * Create visualizations and reference data resources and measure success of your analysis.
  * Tell a story without overwhelming use of the results.
  * For complex analyses walk the audience through the analytical problem solving phase.
